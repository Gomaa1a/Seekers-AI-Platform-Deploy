- Test sender IG account: `@byahmedgomaa` (added as Instagram Tester in App roles)

---

## Phase 0 — Code prep (Claude can do now)
- [x] ~~Add `business_management` to OAuth scopes~~ **REVERTED** — not in scopes, not submitted (see Phase 5/7)
- [ ] Implement real data-deletion logic in `/api/meta/deletion` + `/deauthorize`
- [ ] Wire legal pages into the site (or confirm where they're hosted)

## Phase 1 — Deploy backend to Railway  (YOU)
- [x] Create Railway project + add PostgreSQL + add Redis
- [x] Add backend service from repo, root dir = `backend`
- [x] Set all environment variables (see RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md)
- [x] Update API_BASE_URL + META_REDIRECT_URI with real domain
- [x] Run DB migrations once (`npm run migrate` against public DB URL)
- [x] Generate public domain → record it in VALUES above
- [x] Verify `https://DOMAIN/health` returns 200
- [x] Verify webhook challenge URL echoes back `test`

## Phase 2 — Host legal pages  (DONE — served from backend)
- [x] Privacy Policy live at `https://seekers-ai-platform-production.up.railway.app/privacy-policy.html`
- [x] Data Deletion page live at `https://seekers-ai-platform-production.up.railway.app/data-deletion.html`

## Phase 3 — Configure Meta app dashboard  (YOU)
- [x] Webhooks: callback `…/api/webhooks/meta` + `…/api/webhooks/instagram` + verify token (verified live)
- [x] Subscribe webhook fields (FB: messages, messaging_postbacks, message_deliveries, message_reads, feed / IG: messages, comments)
- [x] Fix META_REDIRECT_URI to `/api/meta/oauth/callback` (Railway var)
- [x] Facebook Login: Valid OAuth Redirect URI `…/api/meta/oauth/callback`
- [x] Settings → Basic: Privacy Policy URL set (`…/privacy-policy.html`, verified 2026-07-03)
- [x] Settings → Basic: User Data Deletion = `…/api/meta/deletion` (verified 2026-07-03)

## Phase 4 — Test data + assets  (YOU)
- [ ] Create reviewer test account in the app → record login in VALUES
- [x] Connect a Facebook Page to the test account (Seekers.ai — webhook subscription verified in logs 2026-07-03)
- [x] Connect an Instagram Professional account to the test account (@seekersai)

### Live E2E test status — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-03)
- [x] **Instagram DM auto-reply VERIFIED WORKING** — webhook → agent → take_thread_control → reply delivered
- [x] **Facebook Messenger auto-reply VERIFIED WORKING** — full fix chain:
  1. App-level webhook `messages` field was UNSUBSCRIBED → subscribed (+ `standby`, `messaging_handovers` via Graph API)
  2. App had no Messenger perms on the Page → fixed by Page disconnect→reconnect (grants scopes + `subscribed_apps`)
  3. Messenger conversation routing: Default AND Social routing → Seekers Chatbot-Testing
  4. Old threads owned by U Connector (kept for other clients) → solved in code: `standby` webhook field
     + auto `take_thread_control` on send (commit 9d729b7) — no need to remove competing apps
- [x] **Conversations inbox shows real chats live** (10s polling) + human-agent reply from the UI
  (conversation.routes.ts + ClientConversations rewrite, commits e2601ba + 82cfced)
- [x] `expires_in` sometimes missing from Meta long-lived tokens → 60-day fallback (commit 293f983)
- Learned: dev-mode senders need an app role; IG senders need the **Instagram Tester** role specifically (+ accept invite)
- Learned: error #100/2534037 = another app owns thread (auto take_thread_control);
  error #27/2534118 = Page admin must enable "Take control of conversations" (Advanced Messaging → Edit app);
  Messenger delivers owned threads ONLY to the owner app (standby field is the escape hatch), IG delivers to all
- Learned: "Reconnect Meta" button ≠ Page reconnect — only Page disconnect→connect re-runs `subscribed_apps`
